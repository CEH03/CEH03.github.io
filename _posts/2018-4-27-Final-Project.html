title: First thoughts on final project
---

<p>
I'm pretty excited about a few ideas, including making digital music, and possibly making a game with Scratch.
</p>

<p>
<em>Let's assume that I'm going to do digital music.</em><br>
I would definitely need to learn how to use the tools inside the program that I choose. I will also need to do some research about good programs to use.
</p>

<p>
My first step will definitely be to find a program that I can use, and after that figuring out how to use it.
