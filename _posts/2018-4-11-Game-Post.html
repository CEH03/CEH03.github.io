<p>Well.<br>Yet another day in a game where my entire life is controlled by corperate scummies.<br>Oh wait.<br>That's real life.</p>
<p>So, I've been recreating my life experiences in a game. People regard it as fictouous. I call it a metaphor.</p>
<p>Trying not to become depressed by the reality of my situation in the world was a challenge. However, I'm very proud to have portrayed life so accurately.</p>
<p>I would love to be able to add more realistic situations to my game. Forcibly forcing people to view reality through games is a thing I very much enjoy, because I enjoy making people miserable.</p>
<p>now I'm sure that everyone wants to play my happy little reality. So here's a link.</p>
