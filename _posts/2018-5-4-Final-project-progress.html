Okay. <br> I tried to find a tool that would let me make digital music. However, All of the tools are either non-chrome compatible, or are online, but much too complicated to figure out.

So my plan at this point is to see if I could make a website for this blog to go onto, or whatever else I would want it to be for.
I would need to find a way to publish a website, if that's even a thing. Possibly with repl.it? But I would learn CSS styling, and some more advanced techniques around dropdowns, navigating a site, etc...
